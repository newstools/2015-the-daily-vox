Among other things, the new deal puts a R225 cap on e-toll fees for light motor vehicles and infrequent users, such as long-distance travellers from outside the province who do not pass more than 30 gantries in a year, will not be charged. The question now is whether motorists who havenâ€™t been paying the tolls at all to begin with, will take the deal and start paying up â€“ or simply continue to ignore the gantries and the bills.
