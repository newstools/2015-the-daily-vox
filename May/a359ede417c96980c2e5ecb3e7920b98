The comedian tweeted that: â€œThanks to some crafty journalism my family and I have spent the whole day trying to figure out which one of us died #awkwardâ€ andÂ his granny Nomalizo told News24Â that the mediaÂ was â€œcreating stories out of nowhereâ€ and, â€œWe ourselves donâ€™t know that person.â€ Sunday Times editor Phylicia Oppelt said the paper still stood by the story,Â soÂ how all of this came to pass is anyoneâ€™s guess.Â Though, if you ask us, this is what happens when the Sunday Times goes all Daily Sun on the country.
